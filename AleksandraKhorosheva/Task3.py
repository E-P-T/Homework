### Task 4.3
'''File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
```python
def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
    pass
print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']

2) Implement a function which receives the file path with students info and writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age.
Result:
```
student name,age,average mark
Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
Brenda Silva,30,7.53
...
Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
