Session 3, Git 

1. Create a local folder and initialize it for git

    git init git_training
    cd git_training

2. Create a text file in the folder and commit it

    copy con example.txt
    first line in the file
    
    F6+Enter to save file

    git add
    git commit -m "my commit"

3. Create a remote repository on GitHub

    Repository Git_example_session_3 was created using GitHub interface

4. Push the local repository to GitHub

    git remote add origin git@github.com:ElenaNKn/Git_example_session_3.git

5. Create a new branch (develop) and switch to it

    git checkout -b develop

6. Create a new branch from 'develop' and switch to it

    git checkout -b develop_new

7. Add the first line in the text file, commit, and push to remote

    git add
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push origin develop_new
    git push origin develop

8. Clone your repository from GitHub into a separate folder

    git clone git@github.com:ElenaNKn/Git_example_session_3.git
    git fetch

9. Create another branch from 'develop' and switch to it using cloned project

    git checkout -b develop_new2

10. Add the first line of the text file (different from the first branch), 
    commit, and push on remote

    git add example.txt
    git commit -m "second commit"
    git push origin develop_new2
   
11. Switch to develop

    git checkout develop

12  Merge the first branch and push changes

    git merge develop_new
    #there is no any conflicts

13. Merge the second branch and push changes

    git merge develop_new2
    # there is a conflict and it can not be automaticaly resolved
