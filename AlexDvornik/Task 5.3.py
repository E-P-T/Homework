Task 5.3
File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV] format.
This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students

def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
    pass

print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']

2) Implement a function which receives the file path with srudents info and writes CSV student information to the new
