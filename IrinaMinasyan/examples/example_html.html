      <p>JACKSON, Ga. (AP) â€” A Georgia man who was recently sentenced to death in the
killings of two corrections officers during an escape attempt five years ago
has died in prison of an apparent suicide, corrections officials said.

Prison guards found Ricky Dubose unresponsive in his cell at the Georgia
Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson around 4:45 p.m. Sunday,
according to a Department of Corrections news release. The guards called for
medical help and began rendering aid. The coroner at the prison declared
Dubose dead at 5:56 p.m.

Dubose, 29, was sentenced to death June 16 after he was convicted of murder in
the June 2017 shooting deaths of Sgt. Christopher Monica and Sgt. Curtis
Billue.
