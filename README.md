of `rss_reader` are printed to console,

+ converted to supported formats directories and files: 
  Folders:
    `html_files`/,
    `pdf_files`/,
    `local_image_url`/,
  Files:
    `database_file/data.json`
Application uses `template\beautiful_news.html` file as core of html stucture and uses it for creating new html formatted files    
By default, the application files are stored inside home directory in a freshly created `Final Task` folder:

    - Windows: C:\Users\User\Final Task

*Some notes*:

+ `--json`-printed results are different from ones, stored in cache; as the cache file is just json formatted file the user can easily explore and
  modify it (modifing is not reccomended), whereas `--json` argument is a part of the user interface, that's why its output is user-friendly.

`--json` output example:

     
                    {"published": "20180814", "News Item": {"title": "When We Eat, or Don’t Eat, May Be Critical for Health", "date": "2018-08-14 19:50:35", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/well/when-we-eat-or-dont-eat-may-be-critical-for-health.html", "image_link": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/autossell/24sci_circadian/24sci_circadian-moth.jpg", "description": "A growing body of research suggests that our bodies function optimally when we align our eating patterns with our circadian rhythms.", "creator": "Anahad O’Connor"}, "source": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml"}

                    {"published": "20220624", "News Item": {"title": "Buck Ellison’s Great White Society", "date": "2022-06-24 14:18:18", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/arts/design/buck-ellison-white-men.html", "image_link": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/autossell/24sci_circadian/24sci_circadian-moth.jpg", "description": "From the driving range to the dude ranch, an artist stages intimate, alluring portraits of U.S. hegemony from within its walls.", "creator": "Travis Diehl"}, "source": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml"}
                    ...
            ...

Why is there a list of feeds inside `--json` structure, not just a single feed? Inside cache file there may be items
with the same `pubDate`, but they may belong to different feeds. So, when there are such items and a user
passes `--date DATE` argument which represents this exact date, then these several items are returned and attributed to
several newly created `Feed` instances. After that, these `Feed` instances are printed. Printing returned news could be
implemented without respect to the feeds they belong to, but in this case it would be hard to distinguish them.

## Parsing XML

XML is parsed by parser implemented from scratch, it exploits the idea of XML *tokenization*, dom-tree is created from
tokens.

*Features*:

+ `XML CDATA` parsing support: whenever CDATA is encountered in XML, it gets recursively parsed and substituted by a
  normal text in the final form.
  \
  XML CDATA example link: https://rss.art19.com/apology-line
+ detecting `invalid XML`: parser notifies user with a wide range of messages whenever invalid syntax or some mistake
  was encountered in XML document.
  \
  Invalid XML example: http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml
  \
  Its fragment (notice tags order):

      In some rss formatted urls there are not given some items like image_link, creator, description... so they are ommited and the utility prints oup the existed ones
