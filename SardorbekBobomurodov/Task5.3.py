# File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
# 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
# ```python

#
# >>> ['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']
# ```
#
# 2) Implement a function which receives the file path with srudents info and writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age.
# Result:
# ```
# student name,age,average mark
# Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
# Brenda Silva,30,7.53
# ...
# Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
# Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
# ```
