1. Create a local folder and initialize it for git;
mkdir ShakhbozIsmailov
cd ShakhbozIsmailov
git init

2. Create a text file in the folder and commit it;
touch test_file.txt
git add test_file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

3. Create a remote repository on GitHub;
git remote add origin https://github.com/schakhboz/myRepo.git

4. Push the local repository to GitHub;
git push origin master

5. Create a new branch (develop) and switch to it;
git branch develop
git checkout develop

6. Create a new branch from 'develop' and switch to it;
git checkout -b subbranch_develop develop

7. Add the first line in the text file, commit, and push to remote;
//added first line to text file
git commit -m "Commit 1"
git push origin subbranch_develop

8. Clone your repository from GitHub into a separate folder;
mkdir new_folder
cd new_folder
git clone https://github.com/schakhboz/myRepo.git

9. Create another branch from 'develop' and switch to it using cloned project;
git checkout -b new_folder_develop develop

10. Add the first line of the text file (different from the first branch),
    commit, and push on remote;

touch text.txt
//add first line
git add ./
git commit -m "add: new line to text.txt file"
git push origin new_folder_develop

11. Switch to develop;
git checkout develop

12. Merge the first branch and push changes;
git merge subbranch_develop
git push origin develop

13. Merge the second branch and push changes;
git merge new_folder_develop
git merge develop

14. Resolve conflict;
git mergetool
git commit -m "Solved"
git push origin develop

16. Commit and push a separate text file with a list of all the commands, which were used to solve the problem;
touch separate_text_file.txt
//add all commands
git commit -m "Commit 3"
git push origin develop
