# Task 5.3
# File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV]
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
# 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students

# 2) Implement a function which receives the file path with students info and writes CSV student information
# to the new file in descending order of age.
