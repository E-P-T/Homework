# Task 5.3
# File data/students.csv stores information about students in CSV format. This file contains the studentâ€™s names,
# age and average mark.
#
# 1. Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
#    def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
#        pass
#
#    print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
#    >>> ['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']

# 2. Implement a function which receives the file path with students info and writes CSV student information
#    to the new file in descending order of age. Result:
#
#    student name,age,average mark
#    Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
#    Brenda Silva,30,7.53
#    ...
#    Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
#    Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
